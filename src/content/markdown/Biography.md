I am a graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
I am working as a research assistant in the People and Robots Lab
(formerly HCI lab). My research interests focus on how humans can effectively
utilize collaborative robots within the manufacturing context. Currently,
working on software tools to address the skills gap of robot operators within
small and medium sized enterprises. I am passionate about building real things
for real people, whether it be robotics, embedded devices, or software tools.

I am seeking a full-time engineering position after graduation.
