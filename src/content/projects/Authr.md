# Authr
Authr is a tool I help develop with the goal of enabling engineers to better allocation collaborative tasks for humans and robots. There is already an extensive writeup on Github [here](https://github.com/Wisc-HCI/authr).

### Primary Contribution
My work tended toward ROS integration and the main data/plan server.
Even on the frontend (written within Angular), I worked mostly with the data model.
