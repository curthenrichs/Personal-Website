I am a graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
I am working as a research assistant in the People and Robots Lab
(formerly HCI lab). My research interests focus on how humans can effectively
utilize collaborative robots within the manufacturing context. Currently, I am
working on software tools to address the skills gap of robot operators within
small and medium sized enterprises. I am seeking a full-time engineering
position after graduation.
