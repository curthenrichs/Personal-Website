# Expert-View Dashboard
Expert-View Dashboard is a training environment for cobot operators to experience
a simulation of expert thought while developing an application. We operationalize
this through four "Expert Frames": Safety, Program Quality, Performance, and Buisness Objectives.

At the time of writing, the repository is private. Please contact me
directly for the source code if interested.
