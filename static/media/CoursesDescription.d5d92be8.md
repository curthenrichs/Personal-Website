My educational philosophy is centered on my triple helix skills model.

The triple helix is composed of three core themes: hardware, software, and users.
In order to effectively lengthen the helix all three need to be added in
roughly equal amounts though not necessarily at the same time. This is due to the deep
interlinking that happens between themes (and the specific skills within each
theme). For instance, when I develop software for a course I balance it with
hardware based side-projects. Or, when studying user interaction, I balance it
with a technical dive into a new framework.

At a larger timescale this explains my educational pursuits. My undergrad was in
computer engineering, which primarily built up my hardware and software knowledge.
Besides the mandatory humanities, I pursued courses in philosophy and creative
thinking to counterbalance my *hard skills*. Likwise, I gained additional perspective
with my buisness courses. These *soft skill* courses afforded my ability to
start thinking about users a diverse group.

For grad school, I pursued a degree in computer science. This balanced out the
hardware heavy undergrad with equal parts human-computer interaction and
software applications.

So how does robotics fit into this?

Robotics is a multi-disciplinary field that requires extensive knowledge of
mechanical, electrical, and software systems. Additionally, to have a robot that
is useful, a good understanding of user experience and buisness objectives is
necessary. While I do not claim the extensive mechanical knowledge within my
model, I have diligently cultivated electrical, software, and user-centered skills
along with their interlinking connections.
